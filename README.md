# Ternary > Binary

This REPO exists to explore the idea of implementing ternary systems to software and hopefully hardware

## Binary

Computers all over the world use the binary system.
in the binary system the computer uses `0` and `1` as truth values

-`0` represents the `off` state of electrical appliances,
-`1` represents the `on` state of electrical appliances.

This system really stuck with the world because of its simplicity and its cheap cost implementation in hardware

## Ternary

Soviets used the `ternary` system for their computers.

These computers were more efficient in processing data than their `binary` counterparts and often outperformed bitwise computers.  
This is because the soviets used the `balanced ternary` system.  
The components of the `balanced ternary` system.

- `+1`
- `0`
- `-1`

## Theory

1 **Trit** stores log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 bits of information while 1 **Bit** log₂(2) = 1 bit of information.

So ,in theory ternary system is more efficient in storing information.
A single **trit** has three possible states, whereas a **bit** has two.

In information-theoretic terms:

- 1 bit stores 1 bit of information
- 1 trit stores log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 bits of information

This makes ternary systems theoretically more information-dense than binary,
and base-3 is mathematically optimal among integer bases.
