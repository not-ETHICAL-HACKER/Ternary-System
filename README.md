# Ternary > Binary

This REPO eists to explore the idea of implementing ternary systems to software and hopeflly hardware

## Binary

Computers all over the world use the binary system.
in the binary system the computer uses `0` and `1` as truth values.  
`0` represents the `off` state of electrical appliances,
`1` represents the `on` state of electrical appliances.  
This sytem really stuck with the world because of its simplicity and its cheap cost implementation in hardware

## Ternary

Soviets used the `ternary` system for their computers.

These computers were more efficient in processing data than their `binary` counterparts and often outperformed bitwise computers.  
This is because the soviets used the `balanced ternary` system.

## Theory

1 `Trit` store 3 units of information while 1 `Bit` stores only 2 units of information.

So,in theory ternary system is more efficient in storing information.
