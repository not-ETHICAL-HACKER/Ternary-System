# Setun (Soviet Ternary Computer)

One of the most notable real-world implementations of a ternary computer was Setun, developed in 1958 at Moscow State University by Nikolay Brusentsov and his team.

Unlike modern computers, which use binary logic (0 and 1), Setun was built using balanced ternary, where each digit (called a trit) could take one of three values:

- (`−1` or `-`)
- (`0`)
- (`+1` or `+`)

This representation made certain operations—such as signed arithmetic—more natural and efficient compared to binary systems.

## Why Setun Was Important

It proved that ternary computing was practical, not just theoretical

Balanced ternary allowed compact number representation

Arithmetic logic was often simpler than equivalent binary designs

The machine was cheaper and smaller than many binary computers of the same era

What Setun Was Not

Setun was not a supercomputer and was not designed to maximize raw performance.
Its importance lies in its architecture and design philosophy, not benchmark dominance.

## Legacy

Despite its advantages, ternary computing did not become mainstream. Binary systems were easier to manufacture reliably using mid-20th-century hardware and benefited from growing industry standardization.

However, Setun remains a powerful example that binary is not the only viable foundation for computing, and it continues to inspire modern research into alternative number systems and logic designs.
